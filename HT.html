<h3>Heavy Tanks</h3>
<p style="color: white;">A heavy tank is a type of armored vehicle that is specifically designed to have enhanced firepower, protection, and considerable weight. These tanks are typically larger and heavier than other types of tanks, allowing them to carry more armor and weaponry. The primary role of a heavy tank is to engage and destroy heavily fortified enemy positions and vehicles.

Heavy tanks are characterized by their thick armor plating, which offers superior protection against enemy fire. This increased armor allows heavy tanks to withstand direct hits from artillery shells, anti-tank missiles, and other powerful projectiles. The thicker armor also provides additional protection for the crew inside the tank.

In terms of firepower, heavy tanks are equipped with larger and more powerful main guns or cannons compared to other tanks. These guns are capable of firing high-explosive shells, armor-piercing rounds, or even guided missiles, enabling heavy tanks to effectively engage and destroy enemy tanks, fortifications, and other military targets.

The trade-off for the enhanced protection and firepower is that heavy tanks tend to have slower speeds and less maneuverability than lighter tanks. Their size and weight can make them more challenging to transport and operate in certain terrains or urban environments.

Overall, heavy tanks are highly effective in offensive assaults, defensive operations, and providing support to ground forces. Their substantial armor, firepower, and durability make them formidable assets on the battlefield, capable of dealing devastating blows to the enemy while ensuring the safety of their own crew.</p>

<h3>Here are some Heavy Tank examples that saw combat</h3>

    <h3>IS-3 Soviet Heavy Tank</h3>
    <img src="IS3M.jpg" width="500">
    <p style="color: white;">The IS-3, also known as the JS-3 (Joseph Stalin 3), is a Soviet heavy tank that was developed and deployed in the post-World War II era. It was designed and produced in the late 1940s and entered service with the Soviet Army in 1945. The IS-3 featured thick armor, advanced frontal protection, and strong firepower. It weighed around 46 tons and had a crew of four. The tank's primary armament was a 122mm D-25T gun, which could effectively engage enemy tanks and fortifications. Despite its late introduction, the IS-3 played a role in subsequent conflicts of the 20th century, such as the Korean War and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.</p>

        <h3>Tiger​ I German Heavy Tank</h3>
        <img src="Tiger131.jpg" width="500">
        <p style="color: white;">The Tiger I, also known as the Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf.E, was a heavy tank used by Germany during World War II. It was one of the most famous and feared tanks of its time. 

The Tiger I had thick frontal armor, sloped at an angle to increase its effectiveness against enemy attacks. It was equipped with an 88mm KwK 36 main gun, which was one of the most powerful and accurate tank guns of the war. This gun could penetrate the armor of most Allied tanks at long ranges.

The Tiger I had a crew of five: a commander, driver, gunner, loader, and radio operator. It had a top speed of around 45 km/h (28 mph), but its weight made it less maneuverable than some other tanks.

The Tiger I first saw combat in 1942 on the Eastern Front and was later deployed in North Africa and Western Europe. Its reputation for its firepower, armor protection, and intimidating presence made it a symbol of German tank technology during the war.</p></section>

    <h3>M103 American Heavy Tank</h3>
    <img src="M103.jpg" width="500">
    <p style="color: white;">The M103 was a heavy tank that was developed by the United States Army in the 1950s. It was designed to counter heavily armored enemy tanks, particularly those used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The M103 featured a powerful 120mm main gun as well as thick armor for enhanced protection.

The M103 weighed around 65 tons and had a crew of five members. It had a top speed of approximately 21 miles per hour (34 kilometers per hour) and a range of about 80 miles (128 kilometers). The tank was powered by a Continental AV-1790-5B V12 engine.

It was primarily deployed in West Germany during the Cold War and served as a deterrent against potential Soviet aggression. Although it never saw major combat, it played a significant role in strengthening the defensive capabilities of the United States Army during that time.

The M103 was eventually phased out of service in the 1970s as newer tank designs with improved technology were developed and introduced.</p>

<h3>Tiger​II​ German Heavy</h3>
    <img src="tigerii.jpg" width="500">
    <p style="color: white;">The Tiger II, also known as the King Tiger or Tiger II, was a heavy tank used by Germany during World War II. It was an improved version of the earlier Tiger I tank, featuring thicker armor, a more powerful 88mm gun, and enhanced mechanical systems. The Tiger II was one of the heaviest tanks to see service in WWII, weighing around 68 tons. Its armor could withstand most enemy tank rounds, and its powerful gun was capable of destroying enemy tanks from long distances. However, the Tiger II suffered from mechanical issues and was costly to produce, so only a relatively small number were built. Despite its limitations, the Tiger II was a formidable presence on the battlefield and played a significant role in several major engagements, including the Battle of the Bulge.</p>
