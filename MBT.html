    <h4>Main Battle Tanks</h4>
    <section>
        <p style="color: white">An MBT, or Main Battle Tank, is a type of armored fighting vehicle that serves as the backbone of modern armored forces. As its name suggests, an MBT is designed to perform a variety of combat roles on the battlefield, including engaging enemy tanks, providing fire support for infantry, and conducting offensive and defensive operations.

            MBTs are characterized by their heavy armor protection, powerful firepower, and mobility. They typically feature a combination of thick composite or modular armor to withstand enemy attacks, large-caliber cannons or smoothbore guns as their primary armament, and advanced targeting systems for increased accuracy.
            
            These tanks are usually equipped with secondary weapons such as machine guns or anti-aircraft systems. They also have high mobility capabilities, allowing them to traverse various terrains, cross obstacles, and maintain a good pace during operations.
            
            The crew of an MBT usually consists of a commander, gunner, loader, and driver. They work together to effectively engage and neutralize enemy threats while minimizing their own vulnerabilities.
            
            Various countries around the world manufacture and use MBTs, each with their own specific designs and capabilities. Examples of well-known MBTs include the Leopard 2, M1 Abrams, Challenger 2, and T-90.
            
            Overall, MBTs provide formidable firepower, protection, and mobility, making them essential assets in modern warfare.</p>
